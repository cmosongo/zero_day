# [0x00] Vagrant

This project shows how Vagrant can be used to set up a development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Vagrant (version X.X.X): [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- VirtualBox (or another supported provider): [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`


2. Change to the project directory:

`cd project-name`


3. Start the Vagrant environment:

`vagrant up`


This command will download the Vagrant box, provision the virtual machine, and set up the development environment.

4. Once the setup is complete, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customization

If you need to customize the Vagrant environment, you can modify the `Vagrantfile` and provisioner scripts located in the `vagrant` directory. Refer to the Vagrant documentation for more details on configuring your environment.

## Usage

- To start the virtual machine: `vagrant up`
- To SSH into the virtual machine: `vagrant ssh`
- To stop the virtual machine: `vagrant halt`
- To destroy the virtual machine: `vagrant destroy`
